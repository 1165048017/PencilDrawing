# Pencil Drawing

Implement the algorithm presented in [1]. You can use the code like below to get a pencil drawing production:

```C++
I = PencilDrawing(im, ks, width, dirNum, gammaS, gammaI);
```

See the demo.m for example.

# Parameters

I add some more parameters for better control of the final image.

* width

	Control the width of the strokes.

# Folder Organization

* inputs

	Include some test images from the website of the publishers (http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/leojia/projects/pencilsketch/pencil_drawing.htm) and other images.

* pencils
	
	Include 5 pencil textures for demonstration. I use “pencils/pencil2.png” by default. You can change it in the PencilDrawing.m.

* results

	Include the results generated by my code. Each image may use different parameters.

* resultsFromPaper

	Include the results of the paper for comparison. I grabbed them in their website (http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/leojia/projects/pencilsketch/pencil_drawing.htm).
