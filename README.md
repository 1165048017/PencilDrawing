# Pencil Drawing

Implement the algorithm presented in [1]. You can use the code like below to get a pencil drawing production:

```C++
I = PencilDrawing(im, ks, width, dirNum, gammaS, gammaI);
```

See the demo.m for example.

# Parameters

I add some more parameters for better control of the final image.

* width

	Control the width of the strokes. See Figure 1 for example.

	<center>![alt text]()
Figure 1: Width of the strokes. left: width = 0; right: width = 2.</center>

* gammaS

	Control the darkness of the strokes. See Figure 2 for example.

	<center>![alt text]()
Figure 2: Gamma of the strokes. left: gammaS = 1.0; right: gammaS = 2.0.</center>

* gammaI

	Control the darkness of the final image. See Figure 3 for example.

	<center>![alt text]()
Figure 3: Gamma of the final image. left: gammaI = 1.0; right: width = 0.4.</center>

# Folder Organization

* inputs

	Include some test images from the website of the publishers (http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/leojia/projects/pencilsketch/pencil_drawing.htm) and other images.

* pencils
	
	Include 5 pencil textures for demonstration. I use “pencils/pencil2.png” by default. You can change it in the PencilDrawing.m.

* results

	Include the results generated by my code. Each image may use different parameters.

* resultsFromPaper

	Include the results of the paper for comparison. I grabbed them in their website (http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/leojia/projects/pencilsketch/pencil_drawing.htm).
